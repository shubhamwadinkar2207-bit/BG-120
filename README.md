---

## 🧩 Functional Modules

1. Authentication
2. Problem Management
3. Code Execution
4. Submissions
5. Leaderboard
6. Contests
7. Dashboard & Profile

Each module evolves through:
**UI → API → Database → Persistent System**

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 🔹 High-Level Architecture

```
Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)
        ↓
API Layer (HTTP Requests)
        ↓
Backend (Node.js / Express)
        ↓
Database (MongoDB / Firebase)
```

* dashboard.html
* profile.html
* login/signup

---

### 2. Client Application Layer

Responsibilities:

* Form validation
* API calls
* State management
* Filtering problems

**State Types:**

* Local State
* Global State

---

### 3. API Layer

| Method | Purpose     |
| ------ | ----------- |
| GET    | Fetch data  |
| POST   | Create data |
| PATCH  | Update data |
| DELETE | Remove data |

---

### 4. Backend Layer

Handles:

* Business logic
* Authentication
* Code execution
* Ranking system

---

### 5. Data Layer

Stores:

* Users
* Problems
* Submissions
* Contests
* Leaderboard data

---

## 🔧 Firebase Setup

This project uses Firebase Authentication and Firestore for login/signup functionality.

1. Copy `firebase-config.example.js` to `firebase-config.js`.
2. Replace the placeholder values with your Firebase web app configuration.
3. Keep `firebase-config.js` local and do not commit it to Git.

The project already includes `.gitignore` to exclude `firebase-config.js`.
