## 🔐 Firebase Setup & Secure Configuration

This project uses Firebase for authentication and data storage. The private Firebase config is kept out of source control.

### Steps to secure your Firebase key

1. Copy `firebase-config.example.js` to `firebase-config.js`.
2. Replace the placeholder values with your Firebase project settings.
3. Keep `firebase-config.js` local and do not commit it.

### Example file structure

- `firebase-config.example.js` — safe template in repository
- `firebase-config.js` — local config file ignored by Git

### Why this is secure

* `firebase-config.js` is listed in `.gitignore`
* This keeps API keys and project IDs out of the public repo
* The app still works locally when the local config file exists

### Local setup

1. Install or use a local static server.
2. Run the app from the project root.
3. Ensure `firebase-config.js` is created before opening the site.

---

## 📦 Deployment

Push your code to GitHub after adding `firebase-config.js` locally. The repo should not include any sensitive Firebase credentials.


* `POST /api/ai/hint`

## 🎨 UI/UX Behavior

| Feature | Static Version | Dynamic Version |
| ------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Loading | Fake           | Real            |
| Data    | Hardcoded      | API-based       |
| Errors  | Not handled    | Handled via API |

---

## 🔗 Backend Integration Strategy

### Phase 1

* Connect frontend with APIs

### Phase 2

* Implement full CRUD operations

### Phase 3

* Add leaderboard & analytics

### Phase 4

* Real-time features + AI integration

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

### Frontend

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

### Backend

* Node.js
* Express.js

### Database

* MongoDB / Firebase

## 🤝 AI Tools Used

This project was developed with the help of AI tools to speed up implementation and improve code quality:

* **ChatGPT** for design guidance and coding support
* **VS Code AI** for intelligent code suggestions
* **GitHub Copilot** for faster JavaScript and README writing

These tools were used to accelerate development while keeping the final code and architecture under manual review.

## 🔧 Firebase Setup

This project uses Firebase Authentication and Firestore for login/signup functionality.

1. Copy `firebase-config.example.js` to `firebase-config.js`.
2. Replace the placeholder values with your Firebase web app configuration.
3. Keep `firebase-config.js` local and do not commit it to Git.

The project already includes `.gitignore` to exclude `firebase-config.js`.
